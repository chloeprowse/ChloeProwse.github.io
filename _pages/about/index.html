<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi my name is Chloe! I am from Dallas, Texas. I am currently pursuing a Masters in Data Science at Southern Methodist University. I aspire to gain more knowledge in the data science field and use that information to find a job working in finance. Since I was a child, I always wanted to work in the business world but was unsure of exactly what my role would be in it. I would like to use the knowledge I acquire to make a difference in how business systems are operated and hopefully make a positive impact in some way. I just recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma with my BA degree in Finance and Management Information Systems. While at the University of Oklahoma, I worked on numerous projects using SQL Database and even set up an automated email response system that professors could utilize using Power Automate. A few activities I enjoy to do is programming and problem-solving when it comes to analytical information. Some other activities, non-degree related, that I like to do in my free time include, tennis, reading, and spending quality time with my family.</p> <p>My overall goal is to immerse myself fully into the data science program and deepen my skills of machine learning and visualization. I want to use the knowledge I learn from this master’s program to cultivate where I hope to end up one day.</p> </body></html>
