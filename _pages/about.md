Hi my name is Chloe! I am from Dallas, Texas. I am currently pursuing a Masters in Data Science at Southern Methodist University. I aspire to gain more knowledge in the data science field and use that information to find a job working in finance. Since I was a child, I always wanted to work in the business world but was unsure of exactly what my role would be in it. I would like to use the knowledge I acquire to make a difference in how business systems are operated and hopefully make a positive impact in some way. I just recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma with my BA degree in Finance and Management Information Systems. While at the University of Oklahoma, I worked on numerous projects using SQL Database and even set up an automated email response system that professors could utilize using Power Automate. A few activities I enjoy to do is programming and problem-solving when it comes to analytical information. Some other activities, non-degree related, that I like to do in my free time include, tennis, reading, and spending quality time with my family.

My overall goal is to immerse myself fully into the data science program and deepen my skills of machine learning and visualization. I want to use the knowledge I learn from this master's program to cultivate where I hope to end up one day.
